		<p>Some people are curious and will click everything. Most people probably won't click this, so don't include anything too important.</p>
		<p>The CSS includes a fix so the buttons do not stick on the hover state on mobile (smaller screens). Part of the fix relies on toggling the "open" class with javascript.</p>

<p>I added one question button at the top and one at the bottom to demonstrate how the slide affects the position of the other content on the page. This button was adapted from another unused button I made and this pen was created during the ongoing development of my over-engineered personal blog template. Check out the related pens <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/nNzawW/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote my first line of code when I was 25, as a PhD student at Caltech. That was one year ago, and it was all Python. Now, I'm practicing JavaScript every day, because I think it will help me be a better journalist, merging writing with interactive visualizations. 
	I'm still very much learning, and I used to be ashamed of that. I used to think that, since I was learning, I could not possibly post examples of my work because they wouldn't be good enough. I now feel that's a foolish mindset, and so I've been trying to put everything I do on this website; by tracking my posts over time, I can see the coding progress that I am making.</p>

<p>Today, I built a two-dimensional random walker (2D) in two different ways. In the first iteration, I'll use <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> and a bit of vanilla JavaScript. Then, I'll show how that code can be reduced considerably by using <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>. Join me!</p>
